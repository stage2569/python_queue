# python_queue
Created a simulation determining the optimal amount of tellers to staff a bank lobby given parameters
Interarrival time = exponentially distributed with a mean of 1
Service time = expontentially distributed with mean of 4.5
Implemented a jockeying process, wherein a customer in queue will move to the teller with the shortest line
